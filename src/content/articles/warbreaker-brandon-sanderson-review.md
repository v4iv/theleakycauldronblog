**Mistborn [The Final Empire](https://theleakycauldronblog.com/articles/mistborn-the-final-empire-review/)** was my introduction to *Brandon Sanderson*'s work. And, while it was great, it was a YA Novel at its core, despite having very mature characterizations. Which meant it felt like I would have appreciated it better when I was younger. So, when I started **[The Well of Ascension](https://theleakycauldronblog.com/articles/mistborn-the-well-of-ascension-review)** I didn't expect it to grow so fast into something more than a mere YA Novel, the *Sanderlanche* at the end was mind blowing. And then **[The Hero of Ages](https://theleakycauldronblog.com/articles/mistborn-the-hero-of-ages-review)** quickly and unsurprisingly became one of the best fantasy books I had ever read! But I had no idea how much I would like Warbreaker when I was getting into it, since I had not heard much, if at all, about this book. The book was not token YA at all, rather, it got into mature in themes like sex, metal health, poverty and torture (though none of it is explicit in nature). I believe if the humor lands for you, you'll love this book.

**Warning: May Contain Mild Spoilers!**

Warbreaker captivated me from the very start with its impeccably paced narrative, striking a perfect balance between suspense and excitement. While the build-up maintained a steady rhythm, it never once felt tedious or drawn-out, keeping me thoroughly engaged throughout.

One of the unexpected delights of Warbreaker was its humor, which consistently brought a smile to my face. The clever wit infused into the dialogue made for delightful reading, adding depth to the characters and the world they inhabit.

> You see, the great thing about madness is that it's all in your head.

Speaking of characters, Warbreaker boasts a cast that is both diverse and compelling. Each character's motivations are intricately woven into the narrative, making even the so-called "evil" ones strangely endearing. The twists and turns, particularly surrounding characters like Denth and Tonk Fah, kept me on the edge of my seat, with Brandon Sanderson expertly leading readers down unexpected paths.

> I like words. And I always learn a few new ones when Father gets angry. I shouldn't neglect my education, now should I?

While the character development was masterfully executed, there were moments of disappointment, such as the underutilization of Parlin(who was a nod to [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)), from [The Legend of Zelda Franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda)) and the seemingly forgettable nature of his demise. This aspect left me feeling somewhat disillusioned with certain characters, particularly Vivenna.

> To Parlin's mind, nothing showed affection like a hunk of something dead and bleeding on the table.

However, the dynamic between Siri and Susebron provided a welcome respite, their interactions brimming with charm and depth. Despite this, I couldn't shake the feeling that Susebron's potential remained largely untapped, leaving me yearning for more exploration of his character.

> 'That is sarcasm,' Susebron said. 'She is quite fond of it.'

Every scene featuring Lightsong added a layer of brilliance to the narrative, his wit and charisma elevating the story to new heights. His ultimate sacrifice was a poignant moment that left me with goosebumps and tears in my eyes, a testament to the depth of his character and the impact of his actions.

> My life to yours. My breath become yours.

Despite its many strengths, Warbreaker is not without its flaws. The ending, in particular, felt rushed, with an excessive amount of exposition crammed into the final chapters. While the revelations were captivating, I couldn't help but wish for a more gradual unfolding of events, allowing readers the opportunity to piece together the puzzle themselves.

Overall, Warbreaker is a captivating tale filled with richly drawn characters and intricate plot twists. While it may not be perfect, its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses, cementing its place as a must-read for fans of epic fantasy.
