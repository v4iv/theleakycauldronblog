The lockdown due to the pandemic has been rough. Everyone’s trying to find a productive hobby to make the most of it. And me being no different, tried to learn *Le Français*. While learning a language is rewarding in itself, it gets a bit tedious after a while. After a while, you start understanding that the bookish language you learn is mostly useless IRL conversations. To my immense surprise, I learnt that the native speakers don’t exactly use *“J’ai une baguette et un croissant”*, all that much.

> Pardon my French.

So, I decided that I need to change my strategy and learn some actually useful lines. And where better to start than from insults. Here are some of my favourite, classy-ish french insults that I found most interesting.

## Et mon cul, c'est du poulet?

**Literally - And is my ass made of chicken?!** This hilarious line isn’t really an insult per se, instead used as a sarcastic retort when someone is trying to bullshit you.

## Si les cons volaient, tu serais chef d'escadrille

**Literally - If the idiots flew, you would be a squadron leader!** Now, this is a proper insult, grand and extravagant, just what you expect from the French. It’s used to call someone - The Idiot-in-Charge.

## Va te faire cuire un oeuf

**Literally - Go make yourself an egg!** When a French person tells you to go make yourself an egg, it means they are annoyed at you. It’s the French way to say *Fuck Off* or *Sod Off*! The origin of this is said to be the old common domestic argument - *‘When a husband would criticise his wife’s cooking, she’d ask him to cook himself.’*

## Intellectuellement, il vit au dessus de ses moyens

**Literally - Intellectually, he lives beyond his means.** Popularly used by famous Haitian-Canadian novelist and journalist [Danny Laferrière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dany_Laferri%C3%A8re). This is a perfect insult for someone exhibiting [The Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

## Il a été bercé trop près du mur

**Literally - He was rocked too close to the wall.** This hilarious insult is my personal favourite. It’s used to subtly imply that one has mental damage due to being accidentally rocked against a wall when they were an infant. The subtlety of this insult is what makes this so funny. I literally laughed for 5 minutes straight when I first read it.

*Which one was your favourite, do you have any that I missed? Do let me know in the comments below.*
