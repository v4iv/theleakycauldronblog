I was watching In Bruges, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. However, the number of actors who have appeared in both In Bruges and the Harry Potter franchise gave me a magical perspective on the movie...

**Warning: Spoilers**

**Gellert Grindelwald** and **Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody** are two wizards — er, hitmen — hiding out in the fairytale (well, technically Muggle) city of Bruges after a job gone horribly wrong. They’ve been sent there by their ruthless boss, **Lord Voldemort** (who is coincidentally named *Harry* in the movie), to lay low.

Grindelwald, young and brash, absolutely hates Bruges. The medieval charm, the canals, the gothic architecture — it’s all wasted on him. He complains non-stop to Moody, who, being older and more experienced, actually enjoys the city’s history and culture. But Grindelwald is impatient, restless, and haunted by their last job.

Through a series of wanderings, Grindelwald meets **Fleur Delacour**, a beautiful and mysterious woman involved in the local film industry. He’s immediately drawn to her and starts pursuing a romance. Meanwhile, Moody takes a more measured approach to their exile, sightseeing and reflecting on their predicament.

As it turns out, Grindelwald and Moody were sent to Bruges because, on their last job, Grindelwald accidentally killed a child while assassinating a priest. This weighs heavily on Moody’s conscience, though Grindelwald tries to push the guilt away with drinking and partying. Their boss, Voldemort, is not pleased with the botched mission.

Things take a turn when Voldemort calls Moody, revealing his true intention: Grindelwald must die for his mistake. Moody, who has grown fond of his reckless young partner, struggles with this command. He tries to persuade Grindelwald to leave Bruges, but Grindelwald, too wrapped up in his misadventures (which include a run-in with a racist house elf, Jimmy), doesn’t take him seriously.

Eventually, Voldemort himself arrives in Bruges, bringing chaos with him. Grindelwald, realizing he’s been marked for death, attempts to flee, but a series of violent encounters lead to a final showdown in the city’s picturesque streets.

As *Avada Kedavara* — er, bullets — fly, Moody sacrifices himself to give Grindelwald a chance to escape, but Voldemort is relentless. In the end, Grindelwald, gravely wounded, is left contemplating his fate. Will he survive? Does he even want to, given the weight of his sins? As the screen fades to black, he wonders if Bruges — beautiful, quiet Bruges — is his own personal purgatory.
