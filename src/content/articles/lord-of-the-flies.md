After reading *Lord of the Flies*, it’s tempting to accept William Golding’s grim hypothesis — that without the rules of civilization, children (and by extension, humans) descend into savagery. The novel still unsettles because it pokes at a myth Western societies have long told themselves: that schooling and tradition civilize us.  

## Golding's background

## The Eton–Waterloo Myth  

Take the famous line, *“The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton.”* Supposedly uttered by the Duke of Wellington (though almost certainly apocryphal), it became shorthand for the idea that elite British schools instilled discipline, teamwork, and leadership through games. This was myth-making at its finest:  

- **False cause fallacy** – Wars are won by logistics, strategy, and manpower, not cricket.  
- **Exclusivity bias** – Most soldiers at Waterloo weren’t Etonians. The victory was collective, not aristocratic.  
- **Propaganda** – The line justified elite dominance by pretending privilege produced virtue.  

In short, the “playing fields” weren’t about education; they were about producing obedient officers and leaders. Schools functioned less like centers of learning, more like **factories of hierarchy**.  

## Golding’s Rebuttal  

Golding’s boys are straight out of that British school culture. If the Eton myth were true, they should have embodied resilience and teamwork. Instead, stripped of adult authority, the structure collapses: rivalry, fear, and violence take over.  

*Lord of the Flies* reads like a direct contradiction of the Waterloo slogan. Where the myth glorifies discipline and leadership, Golding reveals how thin that veneer really is. The training doesn’t hold; savagery lurks beneath.  

## The Tongan Counterexample  

Critics often point to the 1965 case of six Tongan boys, aged 13–16, who survived over a year on a deserted island. Unlike Golding’s children, they cooperated — building gardens, sharing food, and caring for the injured until rescue.  

But comparing the two is a **false equivalence**. Golding’s boys were younger, strangers, and written as products of a competitive, individualistic culture. The Tongans were older, already friends, and grounded in collectivist Polynesian values. Different ages, different cultures, different contexts.  

## Schools as Factories  

Put together, these stories highlight the real role of schools in the industrial and imperial age. They were less about nurturing curiosity and more about producing soldiers, workers, and administrators. Bells, uniforms, rigid schedules — all echoes of the factory floor.  

The Eton myth celebrates this as a virtue. Golding exposes its fragility. The Tongans remind us that cooperation and resilience can emerge — but only where culture and relationships make it possible.  

## Conclusion  

Golding’s pessimism wasn’t universal, but it was pointed: the stories elites tell about civilization are often myths designed to preserve power. Whether through slogans like Waterloo-at-Eton or the sanitized image of schooling, the assumption is the same — discipline equals virtue.  

*Lord of the Flies* forces us to ask: what happens when those myths are stripped away?
