How to sync Child transforms of a GameObject with PUN2

**PUN2** - that’s **Photon Unity Networking** (v2) - is the **Networking** package you end up using when you realize the project you’re working on will need

* A **WebGL** build…
* Which supports **Voice Chat**.

Now, the alternative - **Netcode for Gameobjects** - the networking package provided by **Unity** itself - is a decent solution for sure (according to me - who worked on it for a week). But the voice service provided by Unity - **Vivox** doesn’t support voice over **WebGL**.

Point being - **PUN2** is there. And its voice works over **WebGL**. Can you read the excitement in my words? That’s me with 5 years of **Game Dev** experience now. I’ve heard it’s only gonna get better.

Anyway, you probably know how to set up a prefab which will be instantiated over the internet.

Or if you don’t - that’s fine. I’ll explain. I’ll skip the steps about importing **PUN2** and the **App ID** setup. You can find that stuff anywhere. 

1. Have a prefab in your **Resources** folder.
2. Add a **PhotonView** component to your prefab’s root. Let’s assume it’s a basic **Cube**. We don’t care about syncing animations for now.
3. Now add a **PhotonTransformView** component to your alongside the **PhotonView** (ie. on the same root). This component will be responsible for syncing our **Transform** over the network.
4. Now wherever you wanna instantiate your prefab - you put in the code:

   ```csharp
   PhotonNetwork.Instantiate(prefabPath, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity);
   ```
5. Here **prefabPath** would be the path to your prefab in the **Resources** folder. And the **Vector3** and **Quaternion** are your position and rotation respectively.

And that’s it. Your **Cube** (assuming it has a script updating its position/rotation) will reflect the changes to the other players.

There’s a catch here of course. 

Say, there’s a child of **Cube**. It’s a **Capsule**.  Let’s also say there’s a script on it rotating it along the Y axis.

Now, would this **Capsule’s** movement also be reflected to other players?

Of course not. 

So what do we do?

Now I’ll pay a little lip-service to the idea of adding another **PhotonView** and another **PhotonTransformView** to the child (**Capsule** in our case). But I could never get that solution to work. Maybe it’s supposed to, maybe it’s not. 

Either way, I have a different solution.

See **PhotonTransformView** implements this interface called **IPunObservable**.

```csharp
public class PhotonTransformView : MonoBehaviour, IPunObservable
```

That’s what you wanna inherit from if you wanna share data over the **network stream.** This gives you the method - **OnPhotonSerializeView** which gets called anytime there is a change in the stream. This method also provides us with the stream object itself.

All we need to do is check if the stream is currently **writing** or **reading**, which is the equivalent of **sending** and **receiving** data respectively.

One thing to note here is: the **order** in which the data is **received** is the **same order** in which it is **sent**.

So here’s the gist of the idea: We handle the syncing ourselves. 

Here’s a **bad** way of doing this:

```csharp
using Photon.Pun;
using UnityEngine;

public class ChildTransformSync : MonoBehaviourPun, IPunObservable
{
	[SerializeField] private Transform childTransform;

	public void OnPhotonSerializeView(PhotonStream stream, PhotonMessageInfo info)
	{
    	if (stream.IsWriting)
    	{
        	// Send the current position and rotation to other players
        	stream.SendNext(childTransform.localPosition);
        	stream.SendNext(childTransform.localRotation);
    	}
    	else
    	{
        	// Receive the position and rotation from other players
        	childTransform.localPosition= (Vector3)stream.ReceiveNext();
        	childTransform.localRotation= (Quaternion)stream.ReceiveNext();
    	}
	}
}
```

All you gotta do with this component is:

1. Attach it to the **Capsule**.
2. Add it to the **Observed Components** list in your parent’s (**Cube**) **PhotonView**.

Here are my issues with this script:

1. I gotta add this **component** to every child I need. And make sure they are observed by the parent’s **PhotonView**.
2. I’m sending the **position** for this **Capsule** over **stream** - an object which is never going to move. Only rotate. That too just in the **Y** axis. Why clog up the stream?
3. There is no **interpolation** for these sync ups. So, the **movement** / **rotation** is gonna snap all over the place.

Let’s first handle the first problem. The code handles the syncing for one child - instead lets sync up any number of **Transforms** we want.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Photon.Pun;

public class TransformSync: MonoBehaviourPun, IPunObservable
{
	[SerializeField] private Transform[] transforms; // Array of transforms to sync

	public void OnPhotonSerializeView(PhotonStream stream, PhotonMessageInfo info)
	{
    	if (stream.IsWriting)
    	{
        	// Send data to others
        	foreach (var t in transforms)
        	{
            	if (t != null)
            	{
                	stream.SendNext(t.position);
                	stream.SendNext(t.rotation);
                	stream.SendNext(t.localScale);
            	}
        	}
    	}
    	else
    	{
        	// Receive data
        	foreach (var t in transforms)
        	{
            	if (t != null)
            	{
                	t.position = (Vector3)stream.ReceiveNext();
                	t.rotation = (Quaternion)stream.ReceiveNext();
                	t.localScale = (Vector3)stream.ReceiveNext();
            	}
        	}
    	}
	}
}
```

Next, what was that about the **interpolation**?

Yeah, let’s make a **struct** to hold the data we get from the stream:

```csharp
[System.Serializable]
public struct TransformData
{
    public Vector3 position;
    public Quaternion rotation;
    public Vector3 scale;

    public TransformData(Vector3 pos, Quaternion rot, Vector3 scl)
    {
   	 position = pos;
   	 rotation = rot;
   	 scale = scl;
    }
}
```

Now let’s use an **array** of these **structs** to hold the received data from the stream, instead of setting it right when it’s received.\
\
We’ll also ensure this array is filled at start with the initial positions of these transforms. We don’t want any goof-ups. We are dealing with **structs** here, not **classes**. **Struct** references- when they are not initialized in code - take up **default values** which can screw up our calculations.

Once we have the data - we can lerp to the **network** positions - instead of snapping to them.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Photon.Pun;

public class TransformsSync : MonoBehaviourPun, IPunObservable
{
    [SerializeField] private Transform[] transforms; // Array of transforms to sync
    [SerializeField] private float interpolationSpeed = 10f; // Speed of interpolation

    private TransformData[] _targetTransformData; // Target transform data to interpolate towards

    void Start()
    {
   	 _targetTransformData = new TransformData[transforms.Length];
   	 for (int i = 0; i < transforms.Length; i++)
   	 {
   		 if (transforms[i] != null)
   		 {
   			 _targetTransformData[i] = new TransformData(transforms[i].position, transforms[i].rotation, transforms[i].localScale);
   		 }
   	 }
    }

    void Update()
    {
   	 if (!photonView.IsMine)
   	 {
   		 for (int i = 0; i < transforms.Length; i++)
   		 {
   			 if (transforms[i] != null)
   			 {
   				 transforms[i].position = Vector3.Lerp(transforms[i].position, _targetTransformData[i].position, Time.deltaTime * interpolationSpeed);
   				 transforms[i].rotation = Quaternion.Lerp(transforms[i].rotation, _targetTransformData[i].rotation, Time.deltaTime * interpolationSpeed);
   				 transforms[i].localScale = Vector3.Lerp(transforms[i].localScale, _targetTransformData[i].scale, Time.deltaTime * interpolationSpeed);
   			 }
   		 }
   	 }
    }

    public void OnPhotonSerializeView(PhotonStream stream, PhotonMessageInfo info)
    {
   	 if (stream.IsWriting)
   	 {
   		 // Send data to others
   		 foreach (var childTransform in transforms)
   		 {
   			 if (childTransform != null)
   			 {
   				 stream.SendNext(childTransform.position);
   				 stream.SendNext(childTransform.rotation);
   				 stream.SendNext(childTransform.localScale);
   			 }
   		 }
   	 }
   	 else
   	 {
   		 // Receive data and update target transform data
   		 for (int i = 0; i < transforms.Length; i++)
   		 {
   			 if (transforms[i] != null)
   			 {
   				 _targetTransformData[i].position = (Vector3)stream.ReceiveNext();
   				 _targetTransformData[i].rotation = (Quaternion)stream.ReceiveNext();
   				 _targetTransformData[i].scale = (Vector3)stream.ReceiveNext();
   			 }
   		 }
   	 }
    }
}
```

You’ll notice a check in the Update method:

```csharp
private void Update()
{
	if (!photonView.IsMine)
	{
    	...
	}
}
```

This means our **interpolation** will only occur for objects belonging to other clients. Of course, we’d be handling our **Capsule** rotation ourselves so our calculated rotations will be perfectly accurate already.

So **interpolation** is resolved. All we need to do is:

1. Attach this script to the prefab root.
2. Fill the **transforms** list with the **Transform** components we want to sync up.
3. Get rid of any **PhotonTransformView** components - we don’t need help.
4. Add this component to the **Observed Components** list in our **PhotonView**.

Now, technically what we need is done. You can even stop reading at this point. But let’s see if we can handle limiting the data sent / received over **stream**. 

Why? Because we are **programmers** and we **love optimizing things**.

Let’s first create another **struct** called **TransformSyncSettings**. This will determine which values we want to sync up. It will consist of **3 bools** - *x, y, z*. Each determining the axis we want to sync. 

This structure makes sense for **position** and **scale** - for rotations we should have an additional *w* component as they are **Quaternions** but let’s stick with **euler** angles for now.

```csharp
[System.Serializable]
public struct SyncSettings
{
	public bool x, y, z;
}
```

Let’s get rid of the **TransformData** class and rename it to **TransformSyncData**. It sounds cleaner. 

This struct will hold a **Transform** reference, **SyncSettings** references for position, rotation and scale, and **3 Vectors (NonSerialized)** which will hold on to the network target positions for **interpolation**.

```csharp
[System.Serializable]
public struct TransformSyncData
{
	public UnityEngine.Transform transform;
	public SyncSettings positionSync;
	public SyncSettings rotationSync;
	public SyncSettings scaleSync;

	[HideInInspector] public Vector3 targetPosition;
	[HideInInspector] public Vector3 targetRotation;
	[HideInInspector] public Vector3 targetScale;

	public TransformSyncData(UnityEngine.Transform transform)
	{
    	this.transform = transform;
    	positionSync = new SyncSettings { x = true, y = true, z = true };
    	rotationSync = new SyncSettings { x = true, y = true, z = true };
    	scaleSync = new SyncSettings { x = true, y = true, z = true };
    	targetPosition = transform.position;
    	targetRotation = transform.rotation.eulerAngles;
    	targetScale = transform.localScale;
	}
}
```

Now, in our **TransformsSync** class, let’s adjust the **Start** method so we correctly initialize the positions of our synced transforms. We’ll also update the old **TransformData** array reference to be of the **TransformSyncData** type.

```csharp
[Header("Transform Sync")]
[SerializeField]
private TransformSyncData[] transformsToSync;

private void Start()
{
	for (int i = 0; i < transformsToSync.Length; i++)
	{
    	if (transformsToSync[i].transform == null) continue;

    	transformsToSync[i].targetPosition = transformsToSync[i].transform.position;
    	transformsToSync[i].targetRotation = transformsToSync[i].transform.rotation.eulerAngles;
    	transformsToSync[i].targetScale = transformsToSync[i].transform.localScale;
	}
}
```

Now, let’s take a look at our **OnPhotonSerializeView** code. 

We wanna make use of our **SyncSettings** and only send / receive data which is explicitly defined to be sent through the **inspector**.

This is how we’ll handle the sending:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < transformsToSync.Length; i++)
{
	if (transformsToSync[i].transform == null) continue;
	// Write only the necessary values based on sync settings

	if (transformsToSync[i].positionSync.x)
    	stream.SendNext(transformsToSync[i].transform.position.x);
	if (transformsToSync[i].positionSync.y)
    	stream.SendNext(transformsToSync[i].transform.position.y);
	if (transformsToSync[i].positionSync.z)
    	stream.SendNext(transformsToSync[i].transform.position.z);

	if (transformsToSync[i].rotationSync.x)
    	stream.SendNext(transformsToSync[i].transform.eulerAngles.x);
	if (transformsToSync[i].rotationSync.y)
    	stream.SendNext(transformsToSync[i].transform.eulerAngles.y);
	if (transformsToSync[i].rotationSync.z)
    	stream.SendNext(transformsToSync[i].transform.eulerAngles.z);

	if (transformsToSync[i].scaleSync.x)
    	stream.SendNext(transformsToSync[i].transform.localScale.x);
	if (transformsToSync[i].scaleSync.y)
    	stream.SendNext(transformsToSync[i].transform.localScale.y);
	if (transformsToSync[i].scaleSync.z)
    	stream.SendNext(transformsToSync[i].transform.localScale.z);
}
```

And this, is how we’ll read that data:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < transformsToSync.Length; i++)
{
	if (transformsToSync[i].transform == null) continue;

	// Read only the necessary values based on sync settings
	Vector3 receivedPosition = new Vector3(
    	transformsToSync[i].positionSync.x
        	? (float)stream.ReceiveNext()
        	: transformsToSync[i].transform.position.x,
    	transformsToSync[i].positionSync.y
        	? (float)stream.ReceiveNext()
        	: transformsToSync[i].transform.position.y,
    	transformsToSync[i].positionSync.z
        	? (float)stream.ReceiveNext()
        	: transformsToSync[i].transform.position.z
	);

	transformsToSync[i].targetPosition = receivedPosition;

	Vector3 receivedRotation = new Vector3(
    	transformsToSync[i].rotationSync.x
        	? (float)stream.ReceiveNext()
        	: transformsToSync[i].transform.eulerAngles.x,
    	transformsToSync[i].rotationSync.y
        	? (float)stream.ReceiveNext()
        	: transformsToSync[i].transform.eulerAngles.y,
    	transformsToSync[i].rotationSync.z
        	? (float)stream.ReceiveNext()
        	: transformsToSync[i].transform.eulerAngles.z
	);
	transformsToSync[i].targetRotation = receivedRotation;

	Vector3 receivedScale = new Vector3(
    	transformsToSync[i].scaleSync.x
        	? (float)stream.ReceiveNext()
        	: transformsToSync[i].transform.localScale.x,
    	transformsToSync[i].scaleSync.y
        	? (float)stream.ReceiveNext()
        	: transformsToSync[i].transform.localScale.y,
    	transformsToSync[i].scaleSync.z
        	? (float)stream.ReceiveNext()
        	: transformsToSync[i].transform.localScale.z
	);

	transformsToSync[i].targetScale = receivedScale;
}
```

Moving on to **interpolation**, we want to make sure we only interpolate the values which we have explicitly stated to be sent / received making use of the **SyncSettings** bools.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < transformsToSync.Length; i++)
{
	if (transformsToSync[i].transform == null) continue;

	TransformSyncData data = transformsToSync[i];

	Vector3 currentPos = data.transform.position;
	Vector3 currentRot = data.transform.eulerAngles;
	Vector3 currentScale = data.transform.localScale;

	float t = Time.deltaTime * PhotonNetwork.SerializationRate;

	// Interpolate position if required
	if (data.positionSync.x)
	{
    	currentPos.x = Mathf.Lerp(currentPos.x, data.targetPosition.x, t);
	}

	if (data.positionSync.y)
	{
    	currentPos.y = Mathf.Lerp(currentPos.y, data.targetPosition.y, t);
	}

	if (data.positionSync.z)
	{
    	currentPos.z = Mathf.Lerp(currentPos.z, data.targetPosition.z, t);
	}

	// Interpolate rotation if required
	if (data.rotationSync.x)
	{
    	currentRot.x = Mathf.LerpAngle(currentRot.x, data.targetRotation.x, t);
	}

	if (data.rotationSync.y)
	{
    	currentRot.y = Mathf.LerpAngle(currentRot.y, data.targetRotation.y, t);
	}

	if (data.rotationSync.z)
	{
    	currentRot.z = Mathf.LerpAngle(currentRot.z, data.targetRotation.z, t);
	}

	// Interpolate scale if required
	if (data.scaleSync.x)
	{
    	currentScale.x = Mathf.Lerp(currentScale.x, data.targetScale.x, t);
	}

	if (data.scaleSync.y)
	{
    	currentScale.y = Mathf.Lerp(currentScale.y, data.targetScale.y, t);
	}

	if (data.scaleSync.z)
	{
    	currentScale.z = Mathf.Lerp(currentScale.z, data.targetScale.z, t);
	}

	// Update transform
	data.transform.position = currentPos;
	data.transform.eulerAngles = currentRot;
	data.transform.localScale = currentScale;
}
```

You’ll notice I’ve gotten rid of the **interpolationSpeed** factor here instead opting for **PhotonNetwork.SerializationRate**. I took that cue from the original **PhotonTransformView** class. Can I explain more about it? No, I can’t.

Now, in the inspector add the **Cube** and the **Capsule** to the **transformsToSync** list. And, adjust the **SyncSettings** booleans to your heart’s content.

Finally, at long last we are done. Really done. 100% absolutely-

Yeah, there’s an issue.

If you run a build with this code you’ll notice that if the **Host’s Capsule** rotated somewhat before a **client** joined - the joining **client** would only see the **default rotation** set in the prefab itself. Any **updates** to the rotation afterwards will **reflect perfectly** on the client but that initial situation is an **issue**.

Answer me this - Which got called first **Update** or **OnPhotonSerializeView?**

That’s right. It’s **unclear**. On some machines maybe **Update** got called first, on others maybe it was **OnPhotonSerializeView**. They are not linked. One is never guaranteed to be called after the other.

So let’s be a **responsible programmer** and handle that initial situation. All we gotta do is make sure our updates ie. our **interpolation** only happens once we have started receiving data over the network.

That said, I’m sure you can figure out how to do that.
