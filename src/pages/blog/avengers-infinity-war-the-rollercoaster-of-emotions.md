Yesterday I went to watch Avengers Infinity War, and in short and as expected it was amazing. The first thing that i noticed about the movie is that it doesn't hold back. Right from the beginning, it's brutal and on your face, and while that is true, it does try to neutralize every emotional scene with a one liner. But this doesn't always work out in favor of the movie. Although I agree a lot of the viewers will be kids, i feel that it should have let the emotional scenes sink in. But there's more to this movie than just that, so let's talk in details.

## What I Liked
### Interaction Between The Characters
### Emotional Depth of Characters
### The Mature and Emotional Scenes
### Visuals
### Thanos
## What I Didn't Like
### Neutralizing Emotional Scenes
### Lack of Motive for Thanos
