Friday I went to watch Avengers Infinity War, and in short and as expected it was amazing. The first thing that i noticed about the movie is that it doesn't hold back. Right from the beginning, it's brutal and on your face, and while that is true, it does try to neutralize every emotional scene with a one liner. But this doesn't always work out in favor of the movie. Although I agree a lot of the viewers will be kids, i feel that it should have let the emotional scenes sink in. But there's more to this movie than just that, so let's talk in details.

## What I Liked
### Chemistry Between The Characters
Stark, Banner and Doctor Strange interactions were a delight. Be it Bruce comparing Avengers falling out with The Beatles, or Stark calling Ebony Maw Squidward and "...you are embarrassing me infront of the wizards"  etc were pure gem.

Just when i was recovering from that the Guardians met Thor, stuck on the windshield of their spaceship like a fly. Starlord getting jealous of Thor, and the way Thor took Gamora being Thanos' daughter was hilarious call back to the crazy family Thor has. And who can forget the strange obsession Rocket has with prosthetic body parts, resulting in Thor getting his lost eye.
