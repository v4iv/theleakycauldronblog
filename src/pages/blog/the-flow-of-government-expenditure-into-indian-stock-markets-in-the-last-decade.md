India’s financial landscape has undergone significant transformation over the past decade, driven by government expenditure, shifting investment trends, and the increasing popularity of equities as an asset class. A noteworthy development has been the substantial flow of funds from government spending into the stock markets, particularly via Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) and retail investors. This trend has coincided with a marked decline in bank deposit growth, raising concerns about the sustainability of traditional savings and financial stability in the Indian economy.

## Introduction: A Changing Investment Paradigm

In recent years, India’s stock market has seen significant growth, fueled by a combination of government fiscal policies, low interest rates, and the increasing participation of both institutional and retail investors. The role of government expenditure, in particular, has been critical in shaping the investment landscape, particularly in the form of fiscal stimulus and infrastructure spending. These developments have created a dynamic where large sums of money are flowing into the equity markets, often at the expense of traditional bank deposits. The impact of this shift is evident in the changing composition of household savings and the way Indians invest their money.

This article seeks to explore the intricate flow of government expenditure into the stock markets, focusing on the role of Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs), retail investors, and the resulting impact on bank deposits from 2014 onwards.

## Government Expenditure: A Key Driver of Stock Market Inflows

Government expenditure in India has been a major catalyst for the surge in stock market investments. Over the years, fiscal stimulus programs, infrastructure development, and various welfare initiatives have directly influenced investor confidence, leading to substantial capital flows into the equity markets. Key policy initiatives that contributed to this shift include:

### 1. Infrastructure and Welfare Spending:

The government’s focus on infrastructure development, including projects in transportation, housing, and energy, has not only boosted economic growth but has also spurred stock market investments in sectors that benefit from this spending. For example, companies involved in construction, real estate, and public utilities saw increased investments following government-backed projects.

### 2. Economic Reforms and Stimulus Packages:

After the 2014 general elections, the government rolled out a series of economic reforms aimed at boosting the Indian economy, including the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Digital India initiative. These reforms were complemented by fiscal stimulus packages aimed at reviving sectors hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The latter, in particular, led to a surge in liquidity, which found its way into the equity markets.

### 3. Financial Inclusion and Low Interest Rates:

To promote financial inclusion, the government encouraged digital platforms for investing in equities, which led to greater participation from retail investors. In addition, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) policy of maintaining low interest rates on savings and fixed deposits incentivized many to seek higher returns from the stock market, further inflating market liquidity.

## Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs): The Pillars of the Indian Stock Market

Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs)—including mutual funds, insurance companies, and pension funds—have become key players in the Indian stock market, particularly in the post-2014 period. DIIs are major recipients of capital inflows, which they then deploy in equities across various sectors, thus driving market growth. The following factors highlight how DIIs have influenced the stock market since 2014:

### 1. Strong Government Support for DIIs:

Government expenditure directly impacts DIIs’ investment strategies. For example, in times of fiscal stimulus, DIIs often channel funds into sectors benefiting from government spending. This can be seen in their preference for stocks in infrastructure, energy, and consumer goods, all of which receive substantial government backing.

### 2. Increasing Role of Pension Funds and Insurance Companies:

As India’s pension and insurance sectors grew, so did their exposure to the stock market. Government-backed pension reforms and insurance policy frameworks have encouraged these institutions to invest more heavily in equities, further driving market liquidity.

### 3. Rise in Mutual Fund Participation:

The government’s push for financial inclusion has also seen a rise in mutual fund participation. The mutual fund industry has seen steady growth in assets under management (AUM), driven by both DIIs and retail investors. Government-backed reforms like the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) and Atal Pension Yojana (APY) have further encouraged institutional participation in the stock market.

## Retail Investors: The Surge in Market Participation

Retail investors have become a dominant force in the Indian stock market, largely due to easier access to digital platforms and a shift in financial behavior. The government’s emphasis on digital financial services, such as the introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and the digitization of investment platforms like Zerodha, Groww, and Upstox, has helped in democratizing stock market participation.

**Key Trends in Retail Investment:**

1. **Surge in SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans):** SIPs have become a preferred route for retail investors to gain exposure to the stock market, allowing them to invest in mutual funds in a disciplined manner. The number of SIP accounts has surged in recent years, driven by low-interest rates on bank deposits and increased awareness about equity investments.

2. **Increased Retail Participation:** A significant increase in retail participation was observed during periods of fiscal stimulus (e.g., 2020), where liquidity was abundant, and government expenditure on welfare schemes made investors more optimistic about the future.

3. **Decline in Bank Deposit Growth:** As retail investors flocked to the stock markets, bank deposits began to see slower growth. Low interest rates and a shifting preference for higher returns led to a considerable migration of savings into equities.

## The Correlation: Government Expenditure, DII and Retail Investment, and Bank Deposits

The flow of government funds into the stock market is inextricably linked to the activities of DIIs and retail investors. The data suggests a positive correlation between government spending and both DII and retail investments, while there is an inverse relationship with bank deposit growth.

**Insights:**

• Government Expenditure and Stock Market Investment: Government fiscal policies have consistently fueled both DII and retail investor participation in the stock markets. The correlation between expenditure and market activity is evident, especially during periods of economic stimulus.

• Declining Bank Deposit Growth: The inverse relationship between government expenditure and bank deposit growth highlights the broader shift from traditional savings to equity investments. Low interest rates and increasing stock market returns have led investors to look beyond fixed deposits and savings accounts.

• Sustainability Concerns: While this shift supports stock market growth, it also raises concerns about the long-term viability of bank deposits and traditional savings products. If this trend continues, the financial system must adapt to meet the evolving needs of investors while maintaining stability.

## Conclusion: A Complex Web of Government Policies, Market Dynamics, and Financial Stability

The correlation between government expenditure, DII and retail investments, and the decline in bank deposit growth paints a picture of a shifting investment landscape. The surge in stock market inflows, driven by fiscal measures, low interest rates, and increased financial inclusion, suggests a positive outlook for the equity markets but also highlights the need for cautious monitoring.

As the government continues its focus on infrastructure and welfare programs, it is likely that the flow of funds into the stock market will persist. However, it is essential to ensure that this trend does not lead to an unsustainable shift in financial behavior, where traditional savings vehicles lose their appeal. Policymakers must strike a balance between encouraging market participation and ensuring that the banking system remains resilient to these changes.
