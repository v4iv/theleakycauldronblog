So, diving into *“Tress of the Emerald Sea”* was like stepping into a different Sanderson universe, right? It’s got this light, fairy-tale vibe that’s not what you’d expect after books like [Mistborn](https://theleakycauldronblog.com/blog/mistborn-the-final-empire-review/) or [Warbreaker](https://theleakycauldronblog.com/blog/warbreaker-brandon-sanderson-review/). And Tress, she’s not your typical hero with crazy powers. She’s just super practical and thoughtful, which totally makes sense since she’s used to chilling on her own while washing windows.

**Warning: May Contain Mild Spoilers**

I totally loved how Sanderson showed us Tress’s uniqueness without making her “the chosen one.” And her dad! Instead of the usual unsupportive parent angle, we get this beautiful moment that really shows why Tress is so full of love and empathy.

It’s refreshing to see a character like Tress who’s confident and self-assured. We’re so used to seeing characters who have to overcome self-doubt, but Tress? She grows without losing herself, and she’s never arrogant because she’s always thinking of others.

The world-building blew my mind! The spores, the seas, and the whole sciencey feel to it? Genius. And the Crow’s Song? Gave me major “One Piece” vibes. Captain Crow was basically Pirate Alvida in my head, no joke.

For someone new to the Cosmere, seeing Hoid in all his glory was super exciting. It’s tough to dodge spoilers, but man, the theories are flying! And the Dougs, Fort’s quest for his “HUNT,” and the twist with Ulaam being a Kandra? Mind. Blown.

Okay, the Tosher story might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but hey, variety is the spice of life, right? And the tension with the spores, the sorceress showdown, and that gut-punch with Pakson’s death? Classic Sanderson, keeping us on our toes.

I was rooting for Tress to take over the kitchen from the start, and when it finally happened, it felt like a key piece of her journey. And that dragon encounter? Handled with finesse. Plus, the whole Midnight’s Essence thing? As someone with Thalassophobia, that was intense.

The Phallic Tower being the Sorceress’s spaceship, the “Laptop,” “Tablet,” “Screens,” and “Hacking” stuff? I’m betting they’ll pop up again, maybe in ***Mistborn Era 3 - Ghostbloods***.

If I had to nitpick, Riian’s motivation was a bit fuzzy, which isn’t like Sanderson at all. But the coolest part? I didn’t hate a single character, not even the baddies. And yes, I’m with you on the Cosmere Cat! I’m dying to know if they’re like [Loth cats](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Loth-cat) or just regular Earth kitties.

So, that’s my take on “Tress of the Emerald Sea.” It’s a book that’s as fun as it is deep, and it’s got that Sanderson magic that makes you think, laugh, and gasp all the way through. What about you? What did you think?
