Just like a lot of people around the world I too rely on LoFi Girl to help boost my productivity. “Lo-fi" is short for "low-fidelity" music which embraces the imperfections of low-quality music production. It acts as an ambient sound just like white noise, and helps you provide a rhythm without being distracting. Here's the YouTube channel "Answer in Progress" explaining the science behind LoFi.

But the thing with music is that sometimes it's just so damn good that you can't help putting everything aside and just vibing to it, as they evoke beautiful scenarios in your head, that you may or even may not have experienced. I have made a list of my 10 favourite LoFi tracks and tried to put to words the emotions and imagination they elicit in me.

## 10. dontcry - Redbone

I had no idea that a chill song like Redbone could get even chiller, but this LoFi rendition of Redbone by Childish Gambino proves otherwise. Best served with a side of hot coco and rain on the glass window.

## 9. bits & hits - The Slopes of Blessure

Masterfully created LoFi version of The Slopes of Blessure from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt \[Blood and Wine] Game OST, perfect beats to slay supernatural beasts/play Gwent to.

## 8. GentleBeatz - One With The Wind

With a base sampled from [EDEN - rock + roll](https://youtu.be/geZ_5Ri7ANg) this LoFi track goes beyond the original, and when the music deepens at 1 minute 28 seconds, it makes you feel the quote "I know that a life without love is no life at all" sampled at the beginning [from [Ever After(1998)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ever_After)].

## 7. Kinissue & Raimu - Bliss

With a healthy dose of eastern flute, this fusion beat will transport your mind, straight to tranquillity, away from the bustling life of a metropolitan city.

## 6. Kupla - Lavender

One of the most beautiful LoFi tracks I have ever heard, it's as if the medley of instruments plays on my heartstrings themselves.

## 5.  WYS - The Bad Party

Playing this hauntingly melancholic track on a loop is perfect for those sombre moments in life.

## 4. nymano x Pandrezz - Evening Routine

This beautiful shimmering LoFi track is the music equivalent of taking an evening walk with your crush on streets reflecting neon signs of the big city in the puddles left after a storm.

## 3. Bamf - Lost in Kyoto

I have been following the artist Bamf since he had less than 50 subs on his YouTube. I can proudly say he's one of my most rewarding discoveries, he not only makes the music, he adds beautiful little [8-bit GIFs](https://waneella.tumblr.com) enhancing the aesthetics of his music. And though I love all his tracks, this one takes the cake for my favourite. 

It captures the [kenopsia](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/27720773573/kenopsia) of walking down a quiet canal road at late night/early morning, as mists make eerie shapes as they scatter light on the path illuminated by halogen street lights.

## 2. Plant Guy - Towards The Mountain

This absolutely serene track elicits an imagery of sitting in the grass of the countryside pasture area watching some cows graze in the golden hour of autumn season, as you feel the oncoming harsh winter in the already nippy winds of October.

## 1. sweetbn_ - rowflip

This LoFi track is perfection, from the music to the video. This video has clips edited from the movie Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind, and the music samples a line from the movie too. And very appropriately it evokes the nostalgia of a past relationship as you process the breakup, while still brewing hope for the future.
