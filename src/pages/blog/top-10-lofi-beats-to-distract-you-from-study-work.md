Just like a lot of people around the world I too rely on LoFi Girl to help boost my productivity. â€œLo-fi" is short for "low-fidelity" music which embraces the imperfections of low quality music production. It acts as an ambient sound just like white noise, and helps you provide a rhythm without being  distracting. Here's the youtube channel "Answer in Progress" explaining the science behind LoFi work.
